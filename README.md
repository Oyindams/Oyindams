Hi, I’m @Oyindamola Babatunde, a Computer Science student with great love for Mathematics and Statistics.
I’m interested in Data Science and Analysis.
I’m currently learning AI, Machine Learning, SQL, Deep learning, and neural network.
I’m looking to collaborate on Team projects, Hackathons.
Fun fact: I’ve always loved puzzles and patterns, so when I first started studying data science, it felt like I was unlocking secret codes in real life.
